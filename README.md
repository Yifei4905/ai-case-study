April 5, 1993
* Who are the founders of the company?  
Jensen Huang, Curtis Priem, and Chris Malachowsky founded the company thirty-one years ago in Sunnyvale, California, United States.
  * Jensen Huang  
Jensen Huang was born in Taiwan and emigrated to the United States at a young age with his family. He holds a master's degree from Stanford University and an electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University. Huang obtained valuable knowledge in the semiconductor sector while working at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and LSI Logic before starting NVIDIA.
  * Curtis Priem  
Curtis Priem, an American computer scientist, was also instrumental in establishing NVIDIA. He created the first graphics processor for IBM and holds several patents in graphics and computer architecture. Priem's skills helped shape NVIDIA's early technologies.
  * Chris Malachowsky  
Chris Malachowsky, an American electrical engineer, co-founded NVIDIA and has vast expertise in computer engineering. He attended Santa Clara University and previously worked in engineering and technical management at Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?  
The founders of NVIDIA had a goal to transform computing using the power of graphics processing units (GPUs). In the early 1990s, GPUs' potential remained largely untapped, with most computing jobs reliant on central processing units (CPUs). Huang, Malachowsky, and Priem discovered that GPUs may provide large performance gains for graphics and parallel processing tasks.

  Their ambition was to build a firm that would push the limits of visual computing and establish GPUs as an essential component of contemporary computing. The creators felt that the future of computing will be visual, with GPUs playing a critical role in providing rich, immersive visuals and high-performance computing applications.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?  
NVIDIA received its early investment from venture capital companies, notably Sequoia Capital. Early on, the business raised $20 million in venture money. Sequoia Capital's investment was critical since it provided the financial resources required to develop and launch NVIDIA's first products.

  NVIDIA has developed tremendously over the years, becoming a publicly listed firm. The firm went public in 1999, generating $42 million from  first public offering (IPO). This influx of funding enabled NVIDIA to increase its R&D activities, speed product development, and build a strong market position.
  Since its IPO, NVIDIA has raised significant funds through a variety of financial operations, including secondary offerings and debt financing. The company's solid financial position has allowed it to engage in cutting-edge research, acquire complementary technologies, and maintain its dominance in the GPU industry.
